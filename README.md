Welcome to my homework task of week 4. This homework task focuses on creating a 'Password Generator' which allows the user to enter in exactly which filters they would like to apply to the password.

I have created an application that prompts the user to enter the number of characters they would like to include in their new password, and then proceeds to confirm if they would also like to include lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers in the password.

I have adjusted some styling components to make the application easy to read, and nice to look at. 

I hope you find the application simple to use and enjoy marking my work!
